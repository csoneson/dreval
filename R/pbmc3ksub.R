#' Expression profiles for 2,700 PBMCs
#'
#' This data set contains expression profiles for 2,700 PBMCs. The original data
#' set was obtained from the TENxPBMCData package (pbmc3k data set). This data
#' set was subset to around 1,800 highly expressed genes, normalized using the
#' scran package, and several dimensionality reduction methods were applied.

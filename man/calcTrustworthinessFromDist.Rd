\title{Calculate trustworthiness based on distance matrices}
\usage{
calcTrustworthinessFromDist(distReference, distLowDim, kTM)
}
\arguments{
\item{distReference}{N x N matrix or dist object, representing pairwise
sample distances based on the reference (high-dimensional) observed values.
For each column, samples (rows) will be ranked by the provided distances.}

\item{distLowDim}{N x N matrix or dist object, representing pairwise sample
distances based on the low-dimensional representation.
For each column, samples (rows) will be ranked by the provided distances.}

\item{kTM}{The number of nearest neighbors (excluding the sample itself).}
}
\value{
The trustworthiness value.
}
\description{
The trustworthiness was proposed by Venna and Kaski, as a local quality
measure of a low-dimensional representation. The metric focuses on the
preservation of local neighborhoods, and compares the neighborhoods of points
in the low-dimensional representation to those in the reference data. Hence,
the trustworthiness measure indicates to which degree we can trust that the
points placed closest to a given sample in the low-dimensional representation
are really close to the sample also in the reference data set. The \code{kTM}
parameter defines the size of the neighborhoods to consider.

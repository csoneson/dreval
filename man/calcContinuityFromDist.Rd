\title{Calculate continuity based on distance matrices}
\usage{
calcContinuityFromDist(distReference, distLowDim, kTM)
}
\arguments{
\item{distReference}{N x N matrix or dist object, representing pairwise sample
distances based on the reference (high-dimensional) observed values.}

\item{kTM}{The number of nearest neighbors}

\item{rankLowDim}{N x N matrix or dist object, representing pairwise sample
distances based on the low-dimensional representation.}
}
\value{
The continuity value.
}
\description{
The continuity was proposed by Kaski et al, as a local quality measure
of a low-dimensional representation. The metric focuses on the preservation
of local neighborhoods, and compares the neighborhoods of points in the
low-dimensional representation to those in the reference data. Hence, the
continuity measure indicates to which degree we can trust that the points
closest to a given sample in the reference data set are placed close to the
sample also in the low-dimensional representation. The \code{kTM} parameter
defines the size of the neighborhoods to consider.
